### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm rybot666, I make stuff. Usually useless stuff

I like Rust, and am a member of the [rust-osdev organization](https://github.com/rust-osdev). Check us out! I'm currently working on the rewrite of the bootloader in almost full Rust

#### About me
I'm a he / him. You can contact me on Discord @ `Rybot666#5334`, on gitter (I hang around in the [rust-osdev channels](https://gitter.im/rust-osdev) or in DMs) and on IRC (`rybot666` on Freenode and Mozilla)

That is all
